# Tasks: add-measurement-api

## 0. Prerequisites — the facade fronts nothing until these hold

- [x] 0.1 Self-hosted batch instance deployed (`add-internetnl-cli` task 4.2)
      on a machine with a fixed public IPv4 + IPv6 — `netnl-instance`
      (Hetzner, fixed v4 + v6) live since 2026-08-30; see
      `docs/how-to/deploy-instance-vps.md`
- [x] 0.2 CLI acceptance test against that instance passes unchanged
      (`add-internetnl-cli` task 4.4) — green 2026-08-31 via
      `scripts/acceptance.sh` (evidence under 4.2 below); the daily demo
      measurement has run the unmodified CLI against it since
- [x] 0.3 Owner decisions recorded: service name — **`netnl`** (decided
      2026-08-22; keeps the reference to the mission: an opinion on how the
      internet should work, according to NL); public hostname — decided
      2026-08-31 (owner Mark): `https://api.westerweel.work` primary
      (Cloudflare Tunnel), the Tailscale Funnel `*.ts.net` hostname kept up
      in parallel as a fallback; retention and initial limits — decided
      2026-09-05 (owner Mark): **ratify the code's defaults as the
      published policy**, so docs and behaviour cannot drift (results 7
      days, demo results 24 hours, audit 90 days; 500 domains per request,
      2 concurrent runs; demo 6/hour, 2 concurrent, 2 per IP/hour). The
      private beta exists to test whether they are right, and every one is
      an environment variable — changing one needs a restart, not a
      release. Published in `docs/reference/service.md`.

## 1. Skeleton

- [x] 1.1 Facade package in this repo (own `uv` dependency group: FastAPI,
      pydantic v2), console entry point for the server
- [x] 1.2 Settings from the environment only — upstream endpoint + credential,
      limits, retention, SQLite path; no defaults pointing anywhere
- [x] 1.3 SQLite schema: credentials, id-map (facade id ↔ upstream id ↔
      credential), audit (append-only — enforce via triggers or
      insert-only data layer)
- [x] 1.4 Test harness: no network in tests (upstream client behind the same
      injectable-opener seam as the CLI), `$HOME`-isolation fixture, CI job
      alongside the existing suite

## 2. v2 surface

- [x] 2.1 `POST /requests`: validate, enforce limits, submit upstream with
      the server-side credential, issue a facade id (`^[a-f0-9]{32}$`),
      audit, reply in v2 shape
- [x] 2.2 `GET /requests/{id}` and `GET /requests/{id}/results`: tenant
      check (foreign/unknown id → 404), upstream fetch, passthrough with
      facade id substituted
- [x] 2.3 `GET /metadata/report` passthrough (cacheable)
- [x] 2.4 v2-shaped error bodies everywhere, incl. unimplemented paths;
      provenance header on every reply
- [x] 2.5 Leak test: upstream credential (and its base64 form) greppable in
      no reply, error, or captured log line

## 3. Tenancy, limits, audit

- [x] 3.1 Credential issuance + revocation as operator CLI/runbook
      (revocation effective immediately)
- [x] 3.2 Rate limit, max domains, max concurrent runs — env-tunable, tested
      at the boundaries, 429/400 in v2 shape
- [x] 3.3 Audit records on submit and credential lifecycle; test proves
      append-only (no UPDATE/DELETE path)
- [x] 3.4 Retention job for result bodies and expired audit data, per the
      documented periods

## 4. Deploy and beta

- [x] 4.1 Compose unit next to the batch instance: facade public, instance
      internal-only; TLS at the edge
      - Deploy-aandachtspunt (round-1 fix, m9): schedule `netnl-admin prune`
        frequently (cron) — an expired request stays queryable by its owner
        until `prune` runs, so the compose unit's cron cadence bounds that
        grace window. No code change: `prune` staying a deploy-scheduled job
        rather than an in-process thread is intentional (design.md,
        "Tenancy and identity").
- [x] 4.2 Acceptance test: `internetnl` CLI against the facade, unchanged,
      green — and the instance unreachable from outside
      - Tooling: `scripts/acceptance.sh` (shellcheck-clean, exercises the
        unmodified `internetnl` CLI's submit/results and the
        instance-not-public probe).
      - **2026-08-30**: ran green against the live chain via the Funnel URL
        (facade `https://netnl.tail8f7877.ts.net`): submit of
        westerweel.work (request `2024c2e8ffef4091a84f65658c21eff4`, type
        web) → status `done`, results a valid v2 JSON document;
        instance-privacy-check PASS (`https://5.75.159.196` timeout).
      - **2026-08-31**: Cloudflare Tunnel (`https://api.westerweel.work`)
        brought up in parallel; parity verified against both URLs:
        `GET /health` → 200 on both `https://api.westerweel.work` and the
        Funnel URL; `POST /requests` with wrong credentials → 401 with a
        v2-shaped error body on both.
- [ ] 4.3 Private beta with issued credentials; capacity observations fed
      back into the default limits
      - Runbook ready: `docs/how-to/beta.md` (credential issuance/
        revocation, onboarding, terms, what to observe against the default
        limits and how to adjust them).
      - Public hostname decided (2026-08-31, owner Mark): the runbook now
        hands out `https://api.westerweel.work` by default, Funnel as
        fallback, and instructs running `scripts/acceptance.sh` against
        both before the first credential is issued (see task 4.2's
        2026-08-31 evidence above). The beta itself — issuing credentials
        to real beta users and folding their observations back into the
        default limits — has not started yet.

## 5. Community opening

- [x] 5.1 Docs page: endpoint, terms (only measure hosts you operate),
      limits, retention, batch-vs-website differences, no-SLA statement —
      `docs/reference/service.md` (2026-09-05), linked from the docs index.
- [x] 5.2 Credential-request runbook published — both sides documented:
      the requester's path in `docs/reference/service.md` ("Getting a
      credential": ask, or donate) and the operator's in
      `docs/how-to/beta.md` (issue, reissue, revoke, list).
- [x] 5.3 Handover package: deploy recipe + issuance runbook complete enough
      to run without us; revisit repo split at this point.
      **Decided 2026-09-08 (owner Mark): one repo.** The client, the facade
      and the deploy recipe stay together. They share the HTTP client
      (`netnl.upstream` builds an unmodified `internetnl_cli.client
      .BatchClient`), one test suite, and one openspec administration;
      splitting would cut that band to make a distinction nobody has asked
      for. The handover material itself is complete:
      `docs/how-to/deploy-instance-vps.md` and
      `docs/how-to/self-hosting-pitfalls.md` for the instance,
      `docs/how-to/deploy-facade.md` for the facade,
      `docs/how-to/beta.md` for issuance, and
      `docs/reference/service.md` for what a tenant is promised.
      Revisit only if someone other than the owner actually runs a facade —
      that, not repo tidiness, is what would justify the split.
