# Tasks: add-internetnl-cli

## 0. Access — do this first, it may change everything

- [x] 0.1 ~~Request a batch account on the hosted instance~~ — decided
      2026-08-22 (Mark): accounts are a bottleneck; we go self-hosted and
      expose our own API, hosted-account route dropped
- [x] 0.2 Read the v2 spec (`https://batch.internet.nl/api/batch/openapi.yaml`)
      and write down the four calls we need: submit, status, results, delete
      — done: the calls actually used (submit, status, results, metadata
      report) are documented in design.md's "API mapping" section, and the
      spec itself is vendored at `reference/openapi.yaml`
- [x] 0.3 Skim `poorting/internet.nl_batch_scripts` for the request/response
      shapes before writing a line — cheaper than discovering them from 400s
      — superseded: the official `openapi.yaml` is vendored as ground truth
      (`reference/openapi.yaml`), see design.md

If 0.1 is granted, section 4 becomes optional rather than blocking.

## 1. Skeleton

- [x] 1.1 `uv` project, `pyproject.toml`, console entry point `internetnl`
- [x] 1.2 Config resolution: environment first, then config file, then error —
      endpoint and credentials, no defaults pointing anywhere
- [x] 1.3 `pytest` with an autouse fixture that repoints `$HOME` at a tmp dir
- [x] 1.4 CI that runs the suite and the HOME-isolation check

## 2. Client

- [x] 2.1 `submit` — hosts from `--file`/arguments, prints the request id first,
      then polls
- [x] 2.2 `poll <id>` — resumes any run, including one this machine did not
      start
- [x] 2.3 `results <id>` — renders finished results
- [x] 2.4 Poll loop with tunable interval and maximum duration; reports status
      instead of guessing when a run is unfinished
- [x] 2.5 Errors carry status and endpoint host, never the credential; verify
      with a test that greps the captured output for the secret

## 3. Output and gating

- [x] 3.1 Table renderer: one row per host, plain text, no colour
- [x] 3.2 `--json`: one document on stdout, progress on stderr
- [x] 3.3 Endpoint host, run timestamp and API version on every result
- [x] 3.4 `--fail-on-scored` with an allowlist file; exit codes documented
- [x] 3.5 Unknown or missing subtest renders as unknown, never as passing —
      with a test that feeds a response with a subtest removed

## 4. Self-hosted instance

- [x] 4.1 Deployment page: upstream requirements (2/4/50 minimum, 4/8/100
      recommended, Ubuntu 22.04, root, fixed public IPv4 on the primary
      interface, IPv6), and what it costs to keep running
      (`docs/reference/self-hosted.md`)
- [x] 4.2 Compose/deploy notes following upstream's batch deployment guide,
      including creating a batch user with their `user_manage.sh` —
      `docs/how-to/deploy-instance-vps.md` §2 "Deploy the Internet.nl batch
      stack" (with the `user_manage.sh` step) and
      `docs/reference/self-hosted.md`; the four places where following the
      upstream guide literally still breaks are in
      `docs/how-to/self-hosting-pitfalls.md`.
- [x] 4.3 Document the batch-vs-website differences on the same page: no
      connection test, DNSSEC without registrar lookup, no A/AAAA prechecks
- [x] 4.4 Run the CLI against the own instance unchanged, with only the
      endpoint variable altered — this is the acceptance test for section 1.2
      - Done 2026-09-08. `uv tool install
        'git+https://github.com/MWest2020/internetnl-cli@v1'` on a machine
        that had never run it, then only `INTERNETNL_ENDPOINT`
        (`https://api.westerweel.work`, in
        `~/.config/internetnl/config.ini`) and `INTERNETNL_CREDENTIAL` set:
        `internetnl submit westerweel.work` returned a real scored result,
        including the three known `web_https_tls_*` failures that follow
        from the deliberate no-ACM decision. No flag, no code path and no
        configuration file differs from a run against the hosted API.
      - Repeated at scale the same day: 362 domains measured through the
        unmodified `internetnl_cli` client and its own `poll_until_done`,
        in 15 batches, without touching the library.

## 5. Repo hygiene

- [x] 5.1 README: what it is, what it is not, the "only measure hosts you
      operate" rule, and a five-line quickstart
- [x] 5.2 CHANGELOG from the first commit
- [x] 5.3 Licence (MIT), and a note that this is a client — the tests belong
      to Internet.nl and are theirs
