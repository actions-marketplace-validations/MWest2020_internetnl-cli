"""Anonymous, single-domain demo runs (`/demo/*`), opt-in via
`NETNL_DEMO_ENABLED=1`. See `openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-08-add-demo-run/design.md` for
the pinned decisions (D1-D15) this module implements; in short: one bare
domain, one borrowed credential row nobody ever authenticates as, and
several independent bounds layered in front of the exact same reservation
machinery the authenticated v2 subset already uses — the demo tenant's own
rate/concurrency cap (via `limits.reserve_submission`, called with a
`dataclasses.replace`d `Settings`), a per-IP-bucket hourly cap on *accepted*
submissions, a per-domain cooldown, and a per-IP-bucket hourly cap on
*polls* (status/results GETs).

`register_routes` takes `client` and `call_upstream` as plain arguments
rather than importing anything from `netnl.api` — this module is imported
at `netnl.api` module-load time (for the shared header helper below), so
importing `netnl.api` back from here would be a real import cycle, not the
load-time-deferred kind `netnl.limits` works around with a local import.

Three in-memory structures below (`_ip_accepted`, `_domain_cooldowns`,
`_poll_counts`) are process-global, one per running `netnl-serve` process
(not shared across replicas — see design.md's "Header trust and multiple
replicas" note). Each is swept of expired entries on every call and,
additionally, hard-capped at `_MAX_BUCKETS` distinct keys (an "overflow"
key merges any key past that cap): the per-IP and per-poll buckets are
claimed *before* the reservation that could still fail (see
`_try_claim_ip_slot`/`_try_claim_poll` below), so a flood of distinct
source addresses, each making exactly one request, can grow these dicts
regardless of whether any of those requests is ultimately accepted.
`_MAX_BUCKETS` is the actual hard ceiling that keeps that growth bounded
regardless of how many distinct addresses an attacker can present,
mirroring `netnl.auth._auth_failure_buckets`'s own `_MAX_BUCKETS`/
overflow-key shape (see that module's docstring) rather than merely
asserting boundedness by construction.

**A per-IP or per-domain claim, once made, is never released (round-4
builder-review fix, N1).** An earlier version released the per-IP and
per-domain-cooldown claims whenever a *later* step failed — the tenant-
level rate/concurrency cap in `reserve_submission`, the domain cooldown
check, or the upstream `submit` call itself — on the reasoning that "a
request that produced no result for the visitor should not cost them one
of their bounded slots". Measured on a saturated demo (every reservation
answering 429): 30 POSTs from one IP produced 30 upstream `status` calls
(`limits.refresh_stale_non_terminal`, which always runs *before*
`reserve_submission` and so has already spent up to `max_concurrent`
upstream calls by the time that 429 fires) and left the per-IP bucket
*empty* afterwards — the per-IP cap never actually bit, because every
rejection immediately handed the slot back. Releasing on the upstream-
`submit` failure has the same shape: if upstream is genuinely down, every
visitor's attempt fails at that same step, and releasing would let each
one retry indefinitely, hammering an already-failing upstream harder the
longer it stays down. A claimed slot or cooldown entry is now permanent
for the rest of its window regardless of what happens next — a failed
attempt still costs the visitor's own budget, the same as an accepted one.
This is what makes the hard invariant an anonymous caller cannot exceed
hold unconditionally: at most `per_ip_per_hour` claims per IP per hour,
each spending at most `max_concurrent` upstream calls (refresh) plus 1
(the `submit` call itself, only reached on a successful reservation) —
`per_ip_per_hour × (max_concurrent + 1)` upstream calls, full stop,
independent of how any individual attempt turns out. See design.md's
amended D4/D5 and "HTTP surface" sections for the release matrix this
replaces.
