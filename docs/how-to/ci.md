# Use in CI

`internetnl` was built for pipelines from the start: `--json` for
machine-readable output, `--fail-on-scored` for a gate, and stable exit
codes. This page covers running it from someone else's CI — a GitHub
Actions workflow via the bundled composite action, or any other CI
system by installing the CLI directly.

## a) GitHub Actions

The repository root ships [`action.yml`](../../action.yml), a composite
action. Minimal use:

```yaml
- uses: MWest2020/internetnl-cli@v1
  with:
    hosts: example.org example.com
    endpoint: https://api.westerweel.work
    credential: ${{ secrets.INTERNETNL_CREDENTIAL }}
```

`credential` is a single `username:password` string, split on the
*first* colon: a password may contain one, but per RFC 7617 a Basic
userid never can — a username containing a colon could never
authenticate over HTTP Basic in the first place (a compliant server,
the `netnl` facade included, parses everything from the first colon
onward as the password), so this split is unambiguous for every
credential that could ever actually work. It is the preferred way to
pass a credential to the action: one secret instead of two.
`username`/`password` still work as separate inputs if you already
have the credential split that way:

```yaml
- uses: MWest2020/internetnl-cli@v1
  with:
    hosts: example.org example.com
    endpoint: https://api.westerweel.work
    username: ${{ secrets.INTERNETNL_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.INTERNETNL_PASSWORD }}
```

Provide exactly one of the two forms — `credential`, or both `username`
and `password` — never a mix; the action's "Validate inputs" step fails
closed otherwise.

Pin `@main` to a tag or commit SHA once one exists, the same way this
repo pins its own third-party actions (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
Never put the password (or the combined credential) directly in the
workflow file — always a secret.

Note the trade-off while there is no tag/SHA to pin yet: the action
resolves its own install source from `github.action_repository`/
`github.action_ref`, which are only populated when consumed as `uses:
owner/repo@ref` from another repo. A local `uses: ./` (dogfooding this
action from its own repo, e.g. in the smoke workflow) falls back to
installing from this repo's `main` branch, so that path always tracks
`main` regardless of what you pin `uses:` to elsewhere. Pinning to a
tag or SHA fixes what code the *step definition* runs, but does not
change this fallback's behaviour when it triggers.

Inputs:

| Input | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hosts` | one of `hosts`/`file` | — | space-separated hostnames |
| `file` | one of `hosts`/`file` | — | path to a file, one hostname per line |
| `type` | no | `web` | `web` or `mail` |
| `fail-on-scored` | no | `true` | gate on scored subtest failures (exit 3); must be exactly `true` or `false`, anything else fails the step |
| `name` | no | — | free-form label for the request |
| `allowlist` | no | — | workspace-relative path to an allowlist file (see (c) below); requires `actions/checkout` to have run first |
| `endpoint` | **yes** | — | `INTERNETNL_ENDPOINT` |
| `credential` | one of `credential`/(`username`+`password`) | — | `INTERNETNL_CREDENTIAL`, `username:password` (split on the first `:`), from a secret; preferred |
| `username` | one of `credential`/(`username`+`password`) | — | `INTERNETNL_USERNAME`; alternative to `credential`, pair with `password` |
| `password` | one of `credential`/(`username`+`password`) | — | `INTERNETNL_PASSWORD`, from a secret; alternative to `credential`, pair with `username` |

Output: `results-path`, the path to the raw `--json` results file
written during the run — attach it as a build artifact if you want it
kept:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: always() && steps.<step-id>.outputs.results-path != ''
  with:
    name: internetnl-results
    path: ${{ steps.<step-id>.outputs.results-path }}
```

Give the action step an `id:` to reference its outputs, and use
`if: always()` on the upload step so a result still gets uploaded when
the gate trips the job (that is the point of the gate: it is supposed
to fail the job, not hide the evidence). The `&&
steps.<step-id>.outputs.results-path != ''` guard is explained below —
it is not optional decoration.

Three things to know about that artifact recipe.

`results-path` can point at a **0-byte file** on exit codes 1, 2, or 4
— the CLI redirects its own stdout straight to that path, so a run
that fails before producing JSON (a config error, a transport/API
error, or the poll timeout) still creates the file, just empty; do not
assume a present file means usable JSON.

The `path:` given to `upload-artifact` above is workspace-relative
like everything else `actions/upload-artifact` handles — `${{
steps.<step-id>.outputs.results-path }}` itself resolves to an
absolute path under `$RUNNER_TEMP` (set by the action, not the
workspace), so this works regardless of whether `actions/checkout`
ran. `actions/checkout` is still required, though: the `allowlist` and
`file` inputs above are both workspace-relative paths, so either one
needs the workspace populated by `actions/checkout` first to resolve.

And `results-path` is only ever set by the action's "Run internetnl
submit" step, so it stays **unset** (empty string) if an earlier step
— "Validate inputs" (e.g. a `hosts`/`file` conflict or an invalid
`fail-on-scored`) or "Install uv"/the install step — fails first. A
bare `if: always()` upload step given that empty `path:` errors ("no
files were found"/invalid path) instead of silently skipping, which is
why the recipe above guards on `steps.<step-id>.outputs.results-path
!= ''` as well.

## b) Any other CI (plain CLI)

The action is a thin wrapper; anything that can run `uv` (or install a
Python package and set environment variables) can do the same thing
directly. GitLab CI example:

```yaml
scan:
  image: python:3.12-slim
  variables:
    INTERNETNL_ENDPOINT: https://api.westerweel.work
    INTERNETNL_USERNAME: $INTERNETNL_USERNAME   # CI/CD variable, masked
    INTERNETNL_PASSWORD: $INTERNETNL_PASSWORD   # CI/CD variable, masked+protected
  script:
    - pip install "git+https://github.com/MWest2020/internetnl-cli@v1.0.0"
    - internetnl submit --file hosts.txt --fail-on-scored --json > results.json
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths: [results.json]
```

Credentials are still environment variables only (`INTERNETNL_ENDPOINT`
/ `INTERNETNL_USERNAME` / `INTERNETNL_PASSWORD`, or the single
`INTERNETNL_CREDENTIAL` in `username:password` form — never both at
once) — never command-line arguments. Mark the username/password (or
the combined credential) as masked (and protected, if your CI supports
it) CI/CD variables, the same way you would for any other credential.

## c) The gate: exit codes and what "scored" means

`internetnl submit`/`poll`/`results` return one of these exit codes
(the full table is in
[`openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-08-add-internetnl-cli/design.md`](../../openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-08-add-internetnl-cli/design.md#exit-codes)):

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success (including `results` on a run that has not finished yet) |
| 1 | Configuration error (missing endpoint, unreadable file, bad allowlist) |
| 2 | Usage error, transport failure, or an API error |
| 3 | `--fail-on-scored` gate tripped |
| 4 | `INTERNETNL_POLL_MAX` exceeded while the run was still unfinished |

Exit code 2's message includes the endpoint's own error body verbatim
in the CI log, so against a third-party batch API you do not control
(unlike the `netnl` facade, which is built not to do this) that body
could itself echo your username unmasked.

Exit code 4 is the one most likely to bite a large run: the default
`INTERNETNL_POLL_MAX` is 3600 seconds (one hour), and a batch of many
hosts can legitimately take longer than that to finish scoring. The
composite action's job-level (or workflow-level) `env:` block passes
through unchanged to its `run:` steps — GitHub Actions does not
sandbox a composite action's environment from the calling job's — so
setting `INTERNETNL_POLL_MAX` (raise the timeout), `INTERNETNL_POLL_INTERVAL`
(poll less often), or `INTERNETNL_BATCH_SIZE` (cap how many hosts one
request may contain, forcing you to split a large host list across
multiple `submit` calls/jobs) on the job that calls `uses:
MWest2020/internetnl-cli@v1` reaches the action's own `internetnl`
invocation:

```yaml
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      INTERNETNL_POLL_MAX: "7200"
    steps:
      - uses: MWest2020/internetnl-cli@v1
        with: { ... }
```

"Scored" means a subtest whose Internet.nl API status is `failed` —
Internet.nl reserves `failed` for problems that count toward the
published score; purely informational findings surface as `warning` or
`info` and are shown in the output but never change the exit code.

An accepted, tracked exception is an **allowlist file**, not a
disabled gate: `--allowlist path/to/file` takes `host testname` pairs
(whitespace-separated, `#` comments allowed). A listed failure still
shows up in the output as "accepted" — it just does not trip exit code
3. This is for a specific, named, tracked exception (e.g. "we know
`example.org` fails `web_tls_...` until the certificate is renewed
next week"), not a way to silence a whole class of findings.

A subtest the API omitted for a host renders as **unknown**, never as
passing — a gap in the response is not silent success.

## d) The rule

**Measure your own hosts freely; measure someone else's only where the
measurement is one their operator already invites** (see "The rule" in the
[README](../../README.md)). In CI the second half barely applies and the
first half matters more than anywhere else: a workflow
that runs on every pull request from outside contributors, or that
lets a PR body or branch name influence which hosts get submitted, can
turn "scan my own site" into "scan whatever a stranger asks for." The
tool does not enforce this — you do, by keeping the host list under
your own control (a file committed to the repo, not something derived
from untrusted input).

## e) Getting a credential

Every route needs `INTERNETNL_ENDPOINT` and a credential — either
`INTERNETNL_USERNAME` / `INTERNETNL_PASSWORD`, or the single
`INTERNETNL_CREDENTIAL` (`username:password`, split on the first `:`).
Options, cheapest first:

- An account on the hosted `batch.internet.nl` API (ask upstream).
- A credential on the `netnl` facade at `https://api.westerweel.work`:
  see [Running the netnl private beta](beta.md) for how the beta
  works today, and [Supporter keys](supporter-key.md) for the
  lifetime-key-for-a-donation route.
- [Self-hosting](../reference/self-hosted.md) your own batch instance,
  if your volume or requirements warrant it.
