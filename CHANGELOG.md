# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Nothing a user receives calls this a demo any more. The four
  visitor-facing literals on the anonymous browser surface now name the
  service ("the service is busy right now", "the service is temporarily
  unavailable", "too many runs recently from this network"), the credential
  mail says "Try it in your browser" instead of "Live demo", and the README,
  docs index, service reference and page contract describe the browser page
  as what it is: this service at v1.0.0, measuring for real against the same
  upstream instance, with an anonymous credential and tighter bounds — not a
  scaled-down imitation. The `/demo/*` routes, the `demo-unavailable` code
  and the `NETNL_DEMO_*` variables keep their historical spelling for now;
  renaming those means changing the browser page in the same release.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-05

First tagged release, cut so the bundled GitHub Action can be published to
the GitHub Marketplace and referenced by a stable tag (`@v1`) instead of
`@main`. The user-visible surface — commands, flags, environment variables
and exit codes — is the one pinned in
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-08-add-internetnl-cli/design.md` and stays stable within 1.x.

### Added

- The `netnl` facade now identifies itself to the upstream instance on
  every call (`openspec/changes/facade-followups`): the `User-Agent` sent
  by `netnl.upstream.build_client` now leads with `netnl/<version>`
  before the client library's own `internetnl-cli/<version>` token, so
  facade traffic is distinguishable from a directly-run CLI in the
  upstream operator's logs. Nothing else about the request changes — same
  body, `Authorization`, redirect refusal and error handling as the
  unmodified `internetnl_cli.client.BatchClient`; `internetnl_cli` itself
  is untouched.

- The credential mail (`openspec/changes/polish-supporter-mail`) is now sent
  as `multipart/alternative`: the existing plaintext body stays the source
  of truth, byte-for-byte unchanged, and a new HTML alternative renders the
  same content — same three interpolated values (credential, public
  endpoint, static doc/demo/install links), same single, non-wrapping
  appearance of the credential, HTML-escaped regardless. Mail-client HTML,
  not web HTML: no image, font, stylesheet, script, form, or other
  network-triggering reference of any kind, inline CSS with one dark-mode
  `<style>` block, table layout, single column ≤ 600px. The operator
  notification mail is unaffected (still plaintext-only).

### Changed

- Known tenants keep their own failed-authentication bucket past the
  aggregator's general cap (`openspec/changes/facade-followups`, closes
  `add-measurement-api`'s residual risk N2). The 512-bucket cap on
  distinct username-and-route pairs previously let an attacker burn
  through it with throwaway usernames and then brute-force a real
  tenant's username unattributed inside the per-route overflow record.
  `netnl.auth._record_auth_failure` now recognises a username that
  matches an existing credential row (revoked or not) and, once the
  general cap is reached, still tracks that username in its own bucket,
  up to a second, separately bounded cap (`_MAX_TENANT_BUCKETS = 256`).
  An unknown username is unaffected: it still folds into the overflow
  record exactly as before once the general cap is full.


- `NETNL_SUPPORTER_MIN_AMOUNT`'s default
  (`openspec/changes/polish-supporter-mail`) changes from `0` to `2`: a
  donation now mints a credential only at or above 2.00 in the account's
  currency, resolving the owner input parked as O3 in
  `add-supporter-issuance/tasks.md`. Operators who set the variable
  explicitly see no change; the live homelab deployment already enforces
  this floor via its own configmap.

### Added

- `INTERNETNL_CREDENTIAL` (`openspec/changes/add-single-credential`), a
  single `username:password` alternative to
  `INTERNETNL_USERNAME`/`INTERNETNL_PASSWORD` (split on the first `:`,
  so a password containing one still works); set either form, never
  both — a silent precedence would mask a misconfiguration. A split that
  yields an empty username or password (`:secret`, `alice:`, `:`) is
  also rejected: an empty username would otherwise make the client skip
  the `Authorization` header entirely, turning a typo into a silent
  anonymous request. The composite action gained a matching `credential`
  input (preferred path; `username`/`password` remain a supported
  alternative), with the "Validate inputs" step failing closed unless
  exactly one form is given (including a colon-less `credential`, before
  the install step runs), and both forms never mixing with an inherited
  job-level `INTERNETNL_*` env var. `netnl-admin user add`/`user reissue`
  now refuse a username containing `:` — such a name could never
  authenticate over HTTP Basic in the first place (RFC 7617). The
  facade's own HTTP Basic wire protocol is unchanged; only the
  CLI/action/issuance-facing credential UX collapsed from two secrets to
  one.
- An opt-in webhook bridge on the `netnl` facade
  (`openspec/changes/add-supporter-issuance`): `POST /webhooks/bmc`, gated
  entirely by `NETNL_BMC_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, turns a qualifying Buy Me a
  Coffee donation (`donation.created`, live mode, at or above an
  operator-configured minimum — default 0, i.e. every donation) into a
  `netnl` tenant credential, mailed directly to the donor. Every request is
  verified with HMAC-SHA256 over the raw body before anything else happens
  — no database connection, password hash, mail, or audit row for an
  unsigned or invalid request. Persist-then-mail: a credential and an
  idempotency row (keyed on BMC's own transaction id) are written together
  in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction before mail is ever sent; a mail
  failure revokes the just-minted credential and marks the row failed
  (with an attempt counter) so BMC's own retry mints a fresh key next time
  — a credential that could not be delivered never stays usable, and
  replaying an already-delivered transaction is a safe no-op. No supporter
  PII is stored: only the transaction id, generated username, delivery
  state, an attempt counter and timestamps persist, pruned on the existing
  `NETNL_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` cutoff. Issuance is capped per hour
  (`NETNL_SUPPORTER_MAX_PER_HOUR`) and every state transition is audited
  without ever recording a secret. Credential minting itself
  (`netnl/issue.py`) is now shared between `netnl-admin user add` and this
  bridge, so the two paths cannot silently diverge. An optional
  `NETNL_SUPPORTER_NOTIFY` mails the operator a short, password-free
  confirmation after each successful delivery. New docs:
  [`docs/how-to/supporter-webhook.md`](docs/how-to/supporter-webhook.md)
  (the operator runbook — secret generation, BMC dashboard configuration,
  rollout verification, a test-donation procedure, troubleshooting, and
  security notes) and a rewrite of
  [`docs/how-to/supporter-key.md`](docs/how-to/supporter-key.md) for the
  automatic flow, with manual issuance kept as the documented fallback.
- An opt-in, anonymous demo route family on the `netnl` facade
  (`openspec/changes/add-demo-run`): `POST /demo/requests` accepts exactly
  `{"domain": "example.nl"}` (pydantic `extra="forbid"` makes a list or a
  `type` field structurally impossible), `GET /demo/requests/{id}` and
  `.../results` mirror the authenticated shape, owner-scoped to one
  operator-issued credential row (`NETNL_DEMO_TENANT`) that nobody ever
  authenticates as — revoking or never issuing it is the entire kill
  switch (503 `demo-unavailable`). Never touches authentication: no
  `Authorization` header is read and no password-hashing computation is
  ever invoked on this path. Bounded three ways: the demo tenant's own
  rate/concurrency limit via the facade's existing atomic
  `limits.reserve_submission` (so there is exactly one rate-limiting
  mechanism, not two), a per-IP-bucket hourly cap (client IP from a
  configurable header, `/32`/`/64`-generalised, one shared bucket for
  anything unparseable), and a per-domain cooldown that never returns an
  existing `request_id`. CORS is scoped to exactly one configured origin
  (never echoed, never combined with credentials), with explicit `OPTIONS`
  routes answering 204 so a browser preflight does not hit the 501
  catch-all. A successful demo submission writes exactly one audit row,
  shaped identically to a tenant submission (`event=submit`,
  `credential=<demo tenant>`, `domain_count=1`) — no visitor IP, `Origin`,
  or submitted domain is ever written to disk or a log line, on any path,
  accepted or rejected, proven by grepping the raw database file and
  captured logs across every rejection reason. Its own retention window
  (`NETNL_DEMO_RETENTION_HOURS`, default 24h) is applied on the existing
  `netnl-admin prune` pass, reported separately from the tenant retention
  counters. New docs:
  [`docs/how-to/demo-run.md`](docs/how-to/demo-run.md) (enabling,
  issuing/discarding the borrowed credential, the smoke check, the kill
  switch) and
  [`docs/reference/demo-api.md`](docs/reference/demo-api.md) (the page
  contract the dark-launched demo page relies on). The BMC-bridge that
  would turn a demo visitor into a real tenant is a separate, later
  change and is not built or stubbed here. Post-review hardening pass on
  the same (still unreleased) demo family: the per-IP and per-domain-
  cooldown bounds are now claimed atomically (proven race-free under real
  concurrency, not just `TestClient`); a non-polled run whose upstream
  status went terminal is refreshed before the next reservation, instead
  of occupying a concurrency slot until the retention window prunes it;
  every upstream-originated error and every aggregate-cap 429 reaching a
  demo reply is now a fixed, host-free, tenant-number-free visitor
  literal; a new per-IP poll budget (`NETNL_DEMO_POLLS_PER_IP_PER_HOUR`)
  bounds anonymous status/results polling, and a status poll of an
  already-terminal row is answered from the store with no upstream call;
  `netnl-admin user reissue <name>` re-keys an existing credential row in
  place (revoked or not), the kill switch's previously-missing "turn it
  back on" half.
- `action.yml`: a composite GitHub Action wrapping `internetnl submit`,
  installed from the same ref as the action itself (`uses:
  MWest2020/internetnl-cli@<ref>`). Inputs cover `hosts`/`file`, `type`,
  `fail-on-scored`, `name`, `allowlist` and the `INTERNETNL_*` credential
  trio; the password only ever reaches the process via an environment
  variable, never interpolated into a `run:` line. `fail-on-scored`
  fails closed on anything other than exactly `true`/`false`, and a `--`
  separator keeps a hostname that starts with `-` from being parsed as a
  flag. The CLI's own exit code decides the step's outcome, and the
  `--json` output path is exposed as the `results-path` output. See
  [`docs/how-to/ci.md`](docs/how-to/ci.md) for the GitHub Actions and
  plain-CLI (GitLab CI et al.) recipes and the gate's exit-code
  semantics.
- `.github/workflows/action-smoke.yml`: a smoke workflow exercising the
  action's own input-validation failure paths (no `hosts`/`file`, an
  invalid `fail-on-scored` value) without any real internet.nl-compatible
  API measurement. Each job asserts both that the step failed and that
  `internetnl` never made it onto `PATH`, i.e. that the run never
  reached "Install uv"/the install step — evidence that the failure is
  in input validation, not a later network/transport path.
- `.github/FUNDING.yml`: a Buy Me a Coffee sponsor button.
- [`docs/how-to/supporter-key.md`](docs/how-to/supporter-key.md): the
  issuance model for a lifetime `netnl` tenant credential after a small
  donation — beta, best-effort, no SLA, with the existing per-tenant
  rate limit as the fair-use mechanism. The donation link
  (<https://buymeacoffee.com/mark.westerweel>) is now live; issuance
  itself is still a manual, out-of-band `netnl-admin` process.

### Fixed

- `netnl`'s supporter webhook bridge (`POST /webhooks/bmc`), post-build
  security review round:
  - **Idempotency under concurrency (B1):** measured, 5 concurrent
    identically-signed deliveries for the same BMC transaction minted 5
    credentials and left an active orphan no `supporter_issuance` row
    referenced — mail is sent outside the `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction
    (by design), and a `pending` row committed just before it was
    previously treated as safe to take over by any concurrent call for
    the same transaction. Closed two ways: a `pending` row is only
    eligible for takeover once older than a lease
    (`NETNL_SMTP_TIMEOUT + 30`s, derived from the only thing that can
    legitimately keep it pending) — a younger one answers 503 instead;
    and the mail-outcome write is now a conditional
    `UPDATE ... WHERE txn_id = ? AND username = ?`
    (`store.update_issuance`'s `expected_username`), so a call whose row
    was already taken over revokes its own credential instead of
    overwriting a newer takeover's state. Proven both by direct
    reproduction (`tests/netnl/test_netnl_supporter.py`) and under real
    concurrency on a genuine uvicorn server
    (`tests/netnl/test_netnl_real_server.py`).
  - **A `Sender` must never raise anything else (B2):** `smtplib.SMTP.
    login()` raises a bare `UnicodeEncodeError` (not
    `SMTPException`/`OSError`/`ssl.SSLError`) for a non-ASCII SMTP
    username/password, which previously escaped unwrapped, leaving an
    active, undelivered credential behind. `netnl.mail.smtp_sender` now
    catches bare `Exception`. `attempts` is now incremented at mint/
    takeover time, not only on a confirmed delivery failure, so a
    crash between minting and recording an outcome still counts toward
    `NETNL_SUPPORTER_MAX_ATTEMPTS` instead of retrying unboundedly; the
    hourly cap now also bounds a takeover mint and a newly-recorded
    undeliverable outcome, not only a brand-new qualifying delivery.
  - `NETNL_SUPPORTER_NOTIFY` is now validated at startup (address shape,
    CR/LF) instead of only at send time, and its own mail failure is
    caught as bare `Exception`, not just `DeliveryError`.
  - Non-finite amounts (`NaN`, `sNaN`, `Infinity`, and a bare JSON numeric
    literal that overflows to `inf`) are now rejected as malformed rather
    than reaching a `Decimal` comparison that itself raises
    `InvalidOperation` unhandled — both in the webhook payload
    (`netnl.bmc.parse_delivery`) and in `NETNL_SUPPORTER_MIN_AMOUNT`.
  - `NETNL_BMC_WEBHOOK_SECRET` must now be at least 32 characters.
  - A qualifying-but-unmailable (no usable recipient) delivery now counts
    toward the hourly issuance cap too, closing a previously-uncapped
    write path.
  - The full (up to 128-character) transaction id is now written into
    `audit.detail`, matching `bmc.parse_delivery`'s own field cap (was
    silently truncated to 64).
  - `Request.stream()` disconnecting mid-body-read
    (`starlette.requests.ClientDisconnect`) now answers a clean 400
    instead of falling into the generic 500 "unexpected error" handler.
  - Docs updated to match: the design's 503 label table now says
    `delivery-failed` throughout (not `rate-limited` for the hourly cap,
    which the implementation never actually used); a nonexistent
    `netnl-admin` inspect subcommand reference in the troubleshooting
    table was replaced with a plain `sqlite3` query; the accepted
    post-prune-replay risk (and why a tombstone table was rejected) and
    the plaintext-SMTP relay-password caveat are now documented.
- The CLI now sends a `User-Agent: internetnl-cli/<version>` header on every
  request instead of letting `urllib` fall back to its default
  `Python-urllib/x.y` string — Cloudflare's bot protection in front of the
  primary batch endpoint was blocking the CLI's default `urllib`
  `User-Agent` with an HTTP 403.
- `action.yml`: the `password` input's description no longer contains a
  `${{ secrets.INTERNETNL_PASSWORD }}` example. GitHub's manifest
  validator parses `${{ }}` expressions inside description strings too
  when a remote action is loaded (`uses: MWest2020/internetnl-cli@<ref>`),
  and `secrets` is not a valid context there — this made the action fail
  to load entirely with "Unrecognized named-value: 'secrets'". Loading
  the action locally via `uses: ./` does not exercise this validation
  path, which is why the smoke workflow missed it.
- `netnl` facade hardening from two rounds of post-build review:
  - Unauthenticated scrypt DoS: a missing/unparseable `Authorization`
    header now fails fast with 401 and never touches scrypt; concurrent
    scrypt verifications are capped (`max(4, min(8, cpu_count))`,
    process-local) by a semaphore that waits briefly for a slot before
    answering 503 `overloaded` (with `Retry-After: 1`) on *sustained*
    saturation — a non-blocking version of this cap measured 23 spurious
    503s on the project's own legitimate concurrent-request tests, since
    fixed. `overloaded` is now listed in `netnl.replies.LABEL_STATUS`.
  - Failed authentication is audited (sanitised username, never the
    password, plus the route), aggregated per minute per
    (username, route) with a hard cap (512 buckets, plus one overflow
    bucket per route beyond that) so neither the in-memory aggregator nor
    the audit table it flushes to can grow past a bounded size regardless
    of how many distinct usernames an attacker cycles through. The flush
    itself is a single transaction per sweep (not one autocommit `INSERT`
    per bucket — measured ~5.5s of auth-processing stall for 10k buckets
    before this fix, <100ms after), never raises (a failing flush is
    logged and the window's tally is dropped, never turned into a 500 on
    a legitimate request), and timestamps each row with the failure
    window's own time rather than whenever the flush happened to run. The
    failure count now lives in `detail` (`"<route> failures=<n>"`), not
    `domain_count`. A database created before the `audit.detail` column
    existed is upgraded in place by `store.migrate`'s
    `ALTER TABLE audit ADD COLUMN detail TEXT`, now tolerant of a
    concurrent-startup race on that same `ALTER`.
  - `refresh_stale_non_terminal` no longer fails a submit with 502 when a
    row's upstream status call errors; a credential whose refreshes fail
    *permanently* is blocked with 429 (never a crash) for at most as long
    as `NETNL_RESULT_RETENTION_DAYS` and the deploy's prune cadence allow.
  - `retention.prune`'s stranded-reservation audit now runs against rows
    the main retention delete can no longer have already removed out from
    under it, and tolerates a missing `credentials` row instead of
    silently dropping that entry.
  - The `Basic` auth scheme is matched case-insensitively per RFC 7617.
  - `docs/how-to/deploy-facade.md` and `docs/how-to/beta.md` document the
    503 `overloaded` status and note that topology 1's Tailscale Funnel
    fallback is a second public ingress a Cloudflare edge rate-limiting
    rule does not cover.

### Added

- The `netnl` facade now sends a fixed set of security headers on every
  reply (success and error alike) — `Content-Security-Policy`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`,
  `X-Frame-Options: DENY` — and, opt-in via the new `NETNL_SECURITY_CONTACT`
  variable, an RFC 9116 `security.txt` at `GET /.well-known/security.txt`.
  Prompted by a live Internet.nl webtest against the facade flagging
  `web_appsecpriv_csp`, `web_appsecpriv_x_content_type_options` and
  `web_appsecpriv_securitytxt` as "bad".
- `netnl`, an independent batch API v2 facade (`src/netnl/`, console
  scripts `netnl-serve`/`netnl-admin`) fronting a private batch instance:
  tenant credentials with immediate revocation, per-credential rate/size/
  concurrency limits, an append-only SQLite audit trail, and a
  `netnl-admin` CLI for credential issuance and retention. Facade ids never
  reveal the upstream instance's own ids; every reply carries a provenance
  header naming the facade as an independent instance, affiliated with
  neither internet.nl nor Platform Internetstandaarden. The existing
  `internetnl` CLI works against it unchanged (only its `INTERNETNL_*`
  variables differ). Hardened through the review chain: one SQLite connection
  per request (no cross-tenant row bleed under concurrency), atomic
  reserve-then-submit limit enforcement, anti-SSRF domain validation
  (IP-literals and reserved/internal-use names refused so the facade cannot
  be used to probe the internal network), and a `0600` database file.
- The `internetnl` CLI: `submit`/`poll`/`results` subcommands against the
  batch API v2, with `--json`, `--fail-on-scored` and an allowlist file.
- Hardening out of the review chain: HTTP redirects are refused (Basic
  credentials can never travel to another host), `https` is required unless
  `INTERNETNL_ALLOW_HTTP=1`, request ids are validated before touching a URL,
  unknown-detection uses the instance's own `/metadata/report` test list,
  terminal output is control-character-sanitised, and CI actions are pinned
  to commit SHAs.
- MIT licence, README, and docs (Diátaxis-light: `docs/index.md` plus the
  self-hosting reference page with requirements, addressing caveat and
  batch-vs-website differences).
- Habitat onboarding: role definitions (`.claude/agents/`), role skills
  (`.claude/skills/`) and the builder Stop-gate `scripts/verify.sh` — the
  CLI itself is built through the habitat agent chain.
- `openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-08-add-internetnl-cli/design.md` pinning the CLI surface:
  environment variables, commands, exit codes, gating semantics and output
  shape.
- OpenSpec change `add-internetnl-cli` (proposal, tasks, spec deltas) — the
  initial commit.
